## Others

## MCP

1. [Serena](https://github.com/oraios/serena) You can think of Serena as providing IDE-like tools to your LLM/coding agent. With it, the agent no longer needs to read entire files, perform grep-like searches or basic string replacements to find the right parts of the code and to edit code.

## Notes

1. Deploy subagents — specialized AI personas — to handle specific phases of the development lifecycle. He uses a code-simplifier to clean up architecture after the main work is done and a verify-app agent to run end-to-end tests before anything ships.
